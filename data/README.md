# Polyvore

The polyvore data can be downloaded running the `get_polyvore.sh` script. Then run `./process_polyvore.sh` in `data/polyvore/`.

# Amazon

For the Amazon dataset, you need to ask permission to the authors before using it. The code assumes you have downloaded the metadata and image features files for the Clothing, Shoes and Jewelry category, and placed them in `data/amazon/`.

Then, run the script `prepare_dataset.sh` in `data/amazon/`.
